# Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses logistic regression to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on health-related features.

## 📊 Dataset
- `full_heart.csv`
- Contains 14 features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
- Target column: 0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## ⚙️ Model
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy achieved: 75% (on small sample test data)

## 📈 Visualization
- Correlation heatmap
- ROC Curve for performance evaluation

## 🪨 Mining Engineering Relevance
This model can help in medical screening of mine workers where early detection of heart disease is critical due to extreme physical stress and remote site risks.
